Go slice remove element
There is no built-in function to remove items from a slice. We can do the deletion with the append function.

remove_elements.go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {

    words := []string{"falcon", "bold", "bear", "sky", "cloud", "ocean"}
    fmt.Println(words)

    words = append(words[1:2], words[2:]...)
    fmt.Println(words)

    words = append(words[:2], words[4:]...)
    fmt.Println(words)
}
In the code example, we delete an element and then two elements from the slice.

words = append(words[1:2], words[2:]...)
This removes the first element from the slice. We accomplish the removal by appending two slices omitting the one to be deleted.

$ go run remove_elements.go
[falcon bold bear sky cloud ocean]
[bold bear sky cloud ocean]
[bold bear ocean]
